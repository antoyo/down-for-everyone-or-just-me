Down for Everyone or Just me
============================

Check wether a website is down or not when Firefox cannot load a page.

When Firefox cannot load a page, this add-on will contact the website Down For Everyone Or Just Me to check if the website is down or not. Then it will show the status on the error page shown by Firefox.
It the status cannot be fetched, a button will appear to have the possibility to fetch the status again.
